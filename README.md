# Model-Selection-for-Logistic-Regression
 I performed model selection for logistic regression to solve a classification problem. I completed the following tasks:

1. Build your DataFrame and define your ML problem:
      Load the Airbnb "listings" data set
      Define the label - what are you predicting?
      Identify the features
2.  Create labeled examples from the data set
3. Split the data into training and test data sets
4. Train, test and evaluate a logistic regression (LR) model using the scikit-learn default value for hyperparameter C
5. Perform a grid search to identify the optimal value of C for a logistic regression model
6. Train, test and evaluate a logisitic regression model using the optimal value of C
7. Plot a precision-recall curve for both models
8. Plot the ROC and compute the AUC for both models
9. Perform feature selection
10. Making the model persistent for future use
